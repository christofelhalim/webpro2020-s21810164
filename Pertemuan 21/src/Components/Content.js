    <p>The NBA’s player representatives voted Thursday to support the notion of starting 
      this coming season on Dec. 22, the date that the league has been targeting in its 
      talks about how and when to get teams back on the floor for a planned 72-game season.
      The vote, conducted by player reps within the National Basketball Players Association, 
      is just one part of the process. Among the primary matters to be determined: how much more 
      escrow will be taken from players because of the shorter-than-usual season, and how the league
      and the players will navigate testing and other health and safety issues amid the ongoing 
      coronavirus pandemic.All that has to be worked out before the plans for next season truly 
      become official.
      “Additional details remain to be negotiated and the NBPA is confident that the parties will reach agreement on these remaining issues relevant to the upcoming season,” the union said in a statement.
